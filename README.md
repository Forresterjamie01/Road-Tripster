## Summary
Created a full stack app to help users plan a roadtrip for any purpose, as well as make comments about previous road trips for future reference. In this app, handlebars was utilized to to render html templates rather than build out html on it's own, bcrypt for user validation, and various other pacages for DOM traversal and application interface.
This app requires login and signup fields, a search page that renders the requested data, and a logout field for ending the session. This app draws on a variety of npm packages for functionality. bcrypt was used for user varification, connect-sessions-sequelize and dotenv were used in the server, express was used for routing on the server side, Express -handlebars was the html template engine used to render html files, and bootstrap was the css frameworkm used for styling.
## Workflow
![Code-Screenshot]()
Assignments for this project came together in a fairly ad-hoc manner. They were divided into Models, Controllers, and views, and each contributor did their part to see this project through. 
Every day contributors made contact via slack/discord/zoom to work through issues encountered and to encourage collaborator input. 
Standup meetings were absolutely informal, but very widely utilized. Perhaps limiting the duration of these extremely informal Standups, or at the very least limiting their scope, would be a suggestable strategy.

## Hangups
Each contributor encountered Github issues that necessetated deletion of the repository and re-cloning of said repo in order to continue working. Each contributor got a great deal of help from their tutors, but would benefit a great deal mor if they were widely available as a pool, as opposed to individually linked to each contributor.
